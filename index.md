## About Me

<img src="assets/images/car_engine.jpg" alt="Simon working on car engine" style="float: right; width: 300px; margin: 0 0 1rem 2rem; border-radius: 8px;">

I was always fascinated by technology and how things work. Whether it's taking apart electronic devices as a child or working on my campervan's engine today, I've always been driven by curiosity and the desire to understand and improve systems. This passion naturally led me to pursue mechatronics and robotics, where I can combine my love for mechanical engineering, electronics, and software development.

As a **Mechatronics & Robotics Engineer** with 6 years of experience in the commercial vehicle industry, I specialize in autonomous systems and machine learning. I thrive in dynamic, multidisciplinary environments where I can deliver innovative technical solutions that bridge the gap between theory and real-world applications.
