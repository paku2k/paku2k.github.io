## 🛠️ DIY & Engineering
*I enjoy building things from scratch, focusing on mechanical integrity and electronics.*

* **Custom 3D Printer Mods:** Designed and printed a direct-drive extruder mount in PETG for high-temp printing.
* **Smart Home Integration:** Built a custom ESP32-based lighting controller with a focus on low-power consumption.
* **Mechanical Prototyping:** Experience with soldering, basic CAD (Fusion 360), and manual machining.

## 🏔️ Beyond the Lab
*My passion for the outdoors keeps me grounded and builds resilience.*

* **Outdoor Exploration:** Avid hiker and camper. I enjoy planning multi-day trips that require self-sufficiency and navigation—skills that surprisingly overlap with robotics.
* **Photography:** I often document my trips, focusing on landscape and macro photography.
